# Telemetry Node Update Summary

## Problem
- The `history` node was removed from Firebase
- Data is now stored directly in the `telemetry` node
- Timestamp keys are used instead of timestamp fields (e.g., `1754380067`, `1754380068`)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Data Paths
- **Live Data**: Already using `telemetry` node ✅
- **Historical Data**: Changed from `history` → `telemetry`
- **Analytics Data**: Changed from `history` → `telemetry`

### 2. Timestamp Handling
- **BEFORE**: Expected `record.timestamp` field inside each record
- **AFTER**: Uses the key as timestamp when it's a number (like `1754380067`)
- **Fallback**: Still supports traditional timestamp fields if present

### 3. Updated Functions
- `getHistoricalData()`: Now reads from `telemetry` node
- `getAnalyticsData()`: Now reads from `telemetry` node  
- Both functions handle timestamp keys correctly

### 4. Database Structure Support
Now supports both structures:
```
telemetry/
  1754380067/
    temperature: 35.25
    humidity: 51
    lux: 182
    ...
  1754380068/
    temperature: 35.30
    humidity: 52
    ...
```

OR traditional:
```
telemetry/
  record1/
    timestamp: 1754380067
    temperature: 35.25
    ...
```

## Expected Results
- **Live Tab**: Should show current sensor data from telemetry
- **Analytics Tab**: Should populate charts with historical telemetry data
- **Time Ranges**: Hour/Day/Week/Month filters should work
- **Auto-refresh**: Should update with new telemetry records

## Testing
1. Check the telemetry test page to verify data structure
2. Open Live tab to see if current data displays
3. Open Analytics tab to see if charts populate
4. Try different time ranges in Analytics

## Next Steps
If data still doesn't appear:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify telemetry test shows your recent data
3. Confirm ESP32 is writing to telemetry node with timestamp keys
4. Check that field names match your database structure (temperature, lux, humidity, etc.)

The application should now correctly read from your telemetry node structure!
